Introduction

  The R script, run_analysis.R, uses the plyr package to create the required tidy data file. The script has the following:

    Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set using rbind and cbind.
    Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement using the features file to limit the columns.
    Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set and labels the data set with descriptive variable names using the activity labels file.
    From the data set, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. Filename is "tidy_averages_data.txt".
    
Variables Used

  x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, subject_train and subject_test contain the data from the downloaded files.
  x_data, y_data and subject_data merge the datasets (train, test, subject).
  features contains the correct names for the x_data dataset. activity contains the correct names from the activities variable.
  collen has the number of columns from the variable mean_and_std_features.
  all_data merges x_data, y_data and subject_data in a big dataset.
  tidy_averages_data.txt contains the relevant averages and std data. ddply() from the plyr package is used to create the file.
