# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
Project to Extract and Then Create a new Tidy Data

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

The project uses an R script, run_analysis.R, that does the following:
    Uses the data from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
    Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    From the data set, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
